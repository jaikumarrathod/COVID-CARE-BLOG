                Health care (also health-care or healthcare) is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.

Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes".[2] Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographic barriers (such as additional transportation costs, the possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services), and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers, poor health literacy, low income).[3] Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).

                <p class="lead"></p>
                  <p>As health is concerned with all aspects of human life, in a developing country like India plans for improvement of health services to ensure maintenance of health of the population should be an integral part of the total and overall development program. Modern public health measures are facing a difficult situation because of population growth. In regard to population structure, 2 age groups have been a concern of the health services, namely those 0-15 years and those 65 and older. The child's group constituted 42-44% of the total population, now reduced to 38.2% in 1982 and is a heavy dependent group particularly if another contingent of 20.4% in the 15-24 age group and requiring education is added. With an increasing life expectancy, there is now more than a 6% accumulation of aged persons in need of support. The Indian Council of Medical Research has established a National Institute of Nutrition and a Food and Drug Technology Center at Hyderabad, both of which have been doing useful work on nutrition and food technology. Both the history of public health during the last 100 years and all recent studies and observations amply demonstrate the dominant role played by the environment in the development of physical health and well-being of individuals and the community. The majority of iillnesses in a rural setting arise from 3 situations--pollution of water, soil, and air</p>
